My first blog post is in collaboration with Tess Downing and we are exploring the data set "Roy Kent F**k count".

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-09-26')
richmondway <- tuesdata$richmondway
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

## Introduction

In this blog post, we will be working with the richmondway dataset. This dataset is an overview of the number of times Roy Kent from _Ted Lasso_ says the work f*uck. This data was found in tidytuesdayR from GitHub. It was collected and created as an R package by Deepsha Menghani (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-09-26/readme.md). 

Ted Lasso is a comedy in which an Amerian Football coach is hired to lead an English soccer team. One of the characters, Roy Kent has a love for that four lettered F profanity. 

There are 34 observations in this dataset. The variables we are most interested in looking at are:

**F_count_RK** , double	Roy Kent's F-ck count in that season and episode

**cum_rk_season** , Roy Kent's cumulative F-ck count within that season

**cum_rk_overall**, Roy Kent's cumulative F-ck count across all episodes and seasons until that episode

**F_score**, Roy Kent's F-count divided by the total F-count in the episode

**F_perc**, 	F-score as percentage

**Dating_flag**, Flag of yes or no for whether during the episode Roy Kent was dating the characted Keeley

**Coaching_flag**, Flag of yes or no for whether during the episode Roy Kent was coaching the team

```{r}
# Clean data to only keep what we're interested in
RoyKent_1 <- richmondway |> select(Season, Episode, Season_Episode, F_count_RK, Imdb_rating) 

```


### 1.) Plot to display the relationship between f*ck count and IMDB rating per episode, faceted by season
```{r}
ggplot(data = RoyKent_1, aes(x = Episode, y = F_count_RK)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = Episode, xend = Episode, y = 0, yend = F_count_RK)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Season)


ggplot(data = richmondway, aes(x = F_count_RK, y = Imdb_rating)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = F_count_RK, xend = F_count_RK, y = 0, yend = Imdb_rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Season) +
  coord_flip()

richmond_grouped <- richmondway |> group_by(Season) |> summarise(averg_FK = mean(F_count_RK), averg_score = mean(Imdb_rating))

ggplot(data = richmondway, aes(x= F_count_RK, y = Imdb_rating )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Season)

ggplot(data = richmondway, aes(x= Imdb_rating, y = F_count_RK )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Season)

ggplot( data = richmondway, aes(x = Imdb_rating, y = F_count_RK)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Season)

ggplot( data = richmondway, aes(x = F_count_RK, y = Imdb_rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Season) 
```
