My first blog post is in collaboration with Tess Downing and we are exploring the data set "Roy Kent F**k count".

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-09-26')
richmondway <- tuesdata$richmondway
```

We got this data set from the tidytuesday repository on github and it consists of F bombs dropped by the character Roy Kent in the show Ted Lasso.
