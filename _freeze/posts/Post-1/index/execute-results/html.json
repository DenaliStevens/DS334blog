This dataset is an overview of the number of times Roy Kent from _Ted Lasso_ says the work f*uck. This data was found in tidytuesdayR from GitHub. It was collected and created as an R package by Deepsha Menghani (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-09-26/readme.md). \n\nTed Lasso is a comedy in which an Amerian Football coach is hired to lead an English soccer team.
