This data comes from the data set Tornados. I found the data set on the [github repo tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-16/readme.md){target=\"_blank\"}, and the information posted there came from NOAA's National Weather Service [Storm Prediction Center Severe Weather Maps, Graphics, and Data Page](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor this blog post the variables I'm interested in are \n\n**om**, the id number for each tornado \n\n**yr**, the year it occurred\n\n**mo**, the month it occurred\n\n**st**, the state(s) it affected\n\n**mag**, the magnitude on the F scale\n\n**loss**, the estimated property loss (in dollars)\n\n**ns**, the number of states it affected \n\nThe first thing I want to investigate how many tornadoes each state recorded from 1950 to 2022, for this I will create a map of the US displaying tornado count in each state. I also want to investigate the interaction between magnitude and the number of states that were effected, along with magnitude and loss. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Read in data \n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-05-16')\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 20)\n\ntornados <- tuesdata$tornados\ntornados_smaller <- tornados |> select(om, yr, mo, st, mag, loss, ns)\n\n## map of US and tornado\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nstate_df <- ggplot2::map_data(\"state\")\nstate.abb\nstate.name\n\nabb_name <- bind_cols(state.abb, state.name) |> rename(abb = `...1`,\n                                                       state = `...2`) |>\n  mutate(state = str_to_lower(state)) \n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfull_state_df <- state_df <- left_join(state_df, abb_name, by = c(\"region\" = \"state\"))\n\ntornados_smaller <- tornados_smaller |> group_by(st) |> summarise(count = n())\ntornado_state <- left_join(full_state_df, tornados_smaller, by = c(\"abb\" = \"st\"))\n\nggplot(data = tornado_state, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", aes(fill = count)) +\n  coord_map(projection = \"albers\", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +\n  theme_void() +\n    scale_fill_distiller(\n    type = \"seq\",\n    direction = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Count of Tornadoes in United States from 1950-2022\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like Texas has had the most tornadoes by far.
